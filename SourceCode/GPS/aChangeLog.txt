v1.21 26 Oct 2016
* 

* Changed grid to display in acres. the grid width by half mile is acres displayed for grid
* Changed serial ports....again. the data rec'd event was looping too fast and missing data. Fixed
* Changed settings database to reflect more accurate naming
* Streamlined the NMEA parsing engine to not remove incomplete strings or null out string if not containing both $ and \r\n


v1.2 October 2016
* Fixed the RMC and GGA parsing routine, rather then reading an NMEA line and then updating, read all existing lines and process all at once. 
	- much faster accumulation of data
* Changed OpenGL draw routine from being triggered when RMC rec'd to 5 frames per second and triggering functions from there.
	- three seperate threads - GPS Serial IO and decoding NMEA stream, sectionRelay serial IO, Draw routine. 
* Ability to save and retrieve fields
* Changed the Section tab to remove clutter with less sections
* added section on and off request in section control. Allows the section to delay turning off and when turned on to remain on for 2 secs minimum.
* Fixed fonts consistency
* Added bottom status bar - looks way better in Linux
* Added Arduino serial port to control sectionRelays
* Output the section on off status to Arduino for full external control of sections
* Added port selection to choose port for sectionRelays.
* added hitched or rigid in vehicle
* added antenna height in vehicle
* added port status in status bar
* added distance reset in status bar
* fixed section drawing so it uses section position rather then fix position to end section drawing
* added a guidance page to set overlap
* fixed bug in section control loosing accuracy from converting double to int too soon. (missing a pixel or two)
